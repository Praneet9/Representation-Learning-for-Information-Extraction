##### Representation Learning for Information Extraction from Form-like Documents
_Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder, Navneet Potti, Sandeep Tata, James B. Wendt, Qi Zhao, Marc Najork_ <br>

**Abstract** <br>
We propose a novel approach using representation learning for tackling the problem of extracting structured information from form-like
document images. We propose an extraction
system that uses knowledge of the types of the
target fields to generate extraction candidates,
and a neural network architecture that learns a
dense representation of each candidate based
on neighboring words in the document. These
learned representations are not only useful in
solving the extraction task for unseen document templates from two different domains,
but are also interpretable, as we show using
loss cases.
